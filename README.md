# About
This is a small webapp to determine who should pay who when splitting a total cost between roommates.

This app uses HTML5 for DOM elements and pure CSS for styling. The business logic is implemented with [Angular](https://angular.io/), a Javascript framework. A single purpose [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server is used to serve the build version.
